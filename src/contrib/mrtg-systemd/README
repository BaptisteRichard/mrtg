systemd config file for MRTG
----------------------------

Hello everyone,

This is the systemd config file that I will provide for Debian as of October
2021.

This config file uses some new features released in MRTG 2.17.9, as the
option --fhs updated from FHS 2.3 to 3.0, the new location for default
mrtg.cfg (/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg) and the dynamic creation for main directories,
as /run/mrtg/.
